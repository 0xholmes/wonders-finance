# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```

# Contract Addresses

tokenAddr = "0x6097DF59d21E1ABd2031D87Db02db8888037f68B";

wondersFinanceAddr = "0x6dF579FF0525B7eb42096B60c3D78A80891CB859";
